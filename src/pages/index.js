      <Info title="MORE THAN JUST ULTRALIGHT">
        Our gear weighs about 30% less than anything else on the market, but
        weight isnâ€™t the only thing we care about. We also demand that the hammock
        packs small and travels well. We believe the volume in your pack deserves
        as much love as its weight.
        <br /> <br />
        You'll find no bulky metal parts or thick webbing here. Using actual
        reserve parachute nylon and our button link system, we compress the
        hammock into a very small stuff sack, keeping it as unnoticed in your pack
        as it is on the scale.
